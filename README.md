# Home of Number 7
Number 7 is a small program written on java which can help you a lot when you are working with formulas. It is completely open source.
#### What does it do ?
It substitutes values in formulas, also it can automatically convert input parameters from a unit to another. So you don't even have to convert them. 
### Usages
* Homework
* Not only homework

### How to use : 3 simple steps

**First : Add a unit**
Click on the Units button and then add a unit
Tip:

Unit|Range/S.I.|Relation
----------------|--------------|------------
Name of the unit|e.g. The range for kM is M. For dL is L.|For cM the relation is 100. For dL R. is 0.1.

The relation for a new Range/S.I. is alwasy 1. To get the relation for another value you just have to convert the Range/S.I. value into what you want. For example 1 M is 100 cm. And 1 M is 0.001 kM.

**Second : Add a formula**

This is pretty straightforward, just add your formula. 
The name should only include letters, numbers and spaces.
The formula should be supported by exp4j.
List of all supported words:
* abs: absolute value
* acos: arc cosine
* asin: arc sine
* atan: arc tangent
* cbrt: cubic root
* ceil: nearest upper integer
* cos: cosine
* cosh: hyperbolic cosine
* exp: euler's number raised to the power (e^x)
* floor: nearest lower integer
* log: logarithmus naturalis (base e)
* log10: logarithm (base 10)
* log2: logarithm (base 2)
* sin: sine
* sinh: hyperbolic sine
* sqrt: square root
* tan: tangent
* tanh: hyperbolic tangent
* signum: signum function
Also it supports the scientific notation. e.g. 1.0e-32. 
The powers work like this 8^2

**Third : Enjoy!**
The rest is pretty straightforward
